## Description

This project is a fully functional web-based music player. Users can play, pause, skip, shuffle, and repeat songs, as well as adjust volume levels. The app features a dynamic image list of album covers that updates as the current track changes.

## Features

-   Play/Pause functionality
-   Next/Previous track navigation
-   Shuffle and Repeat modes
-   Volume control with mute option
-   Progress bar for track navigation
-   Display of song title, artist, and album information
-   Dynamic album cover list with active track highlighting

## File Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web application
-   `style.css`: Styles for the web application
-   `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the main logic for the music player
-   `songs/`: Folder containing the audio files
-   `images/`: Folder containing album cover images

## How to Use

1. Place your audio files in the `songs/` directory.
2. Add corresponding cover images to the `images/` directory.
3. Modify the `songList` array in the `script.js` file to include your songs and images.

Example:

```javascript
const songList = [
    {
        title: "Astroscape Motivation",
        artist: "DayNightMorning",
        album: "Motivated",
        src: "songs/song1.mp3",
        cover: "images/cover1.jpg",
    },
    // Add more songs here
];
```
